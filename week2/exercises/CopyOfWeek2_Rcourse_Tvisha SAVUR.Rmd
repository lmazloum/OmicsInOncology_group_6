## Exercise 2
* from https://alexd106.github.io/intro2R/exercise_2.html

#Question 2
```{r}
myNumber <- 12.43

# natural log
log(myNumber)

# log base 10
log10(myNumber)

#log base 2
log2(myNumber)

#square root
sqrt(myNumber)

#antilog AKA e to the power
2.71828183^(myNumber)
```

#Question 3
```{r}
#Area of a circle with diameter 20 cm
area_circle <- ((10^2)*pi)
print(area_circle)
```

#Question 4
```{r}
#Calculate the cube root of 14x0.51
myNumber2 <- 14*0.51
myNumber2^(1/3)
```


#Question 5 & 6
```{r}
#Assign weights to a vector called weight
weight <- c(69, 62, 57, 59, 59, 64, 56, 66, 67, 66)
print(weight)

#mean of weights
mean_weight <- mean(weight)
print(mean_weight)

#variance of weights
variance_weight <- var(weight)
print (variance_weight)

#standard deviance of weights
sd_weight <- sd(weight)
print(sd_weight)

#range of weights
range_weight <- range(weight)
print(range_weight)

#number of children in weight vector
length_weight <- length(weight)
print(length_weight)
```
#Question 7
```{r}
#Create height vector
height <- c(112, 102, 83, 84, 99, 90, 77, 112, 133, 112)
print(height)

#Summarise and print height vector elements
print(summary(height))

#Extract the height of the 2nd, 3rd, 9th and 10th child and assign these heights to a variable called some_child
some_child <- height[c(2,3,9,10)]
print(some_child)

#extract all the heights of children less than or equal to 99 cm and assign to a variable called shorter_child
shorter_child <- height[height <= 99]
print(shorter_child)
```

#Question 8
```{r}
#define weight vector
weight <- c(69, 62, 57, 59, 59, 64, 56, 66, 67, 66)
#define height vector
height <- c(1.12, 1.02, .83, .84, .99, .90, .77, 1.12, 1.33, 1.12)
#calculate height squared
height_squared <- height^2
#calculate BMI & print
bmi <- weight/height_squared
print(bmi)
```

#Question 9
```{r}
seq1 <- seq(from = 0, to = 1, by = 0.1)
print(seq1)
```
#Question 10
```{r}
seq2 <- rev(seq(from = 1, to = 10, by = 0.5))
print(seq2)
```
#Question 11
```{r}

```

#Question 12
```{r}

```
